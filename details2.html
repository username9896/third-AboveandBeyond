    <h3>Between 2014 and 2021, Daimler AG produced the Mercedes-Benz W205, the fourth generation of the Mercedes-Benz
        C-Class. The W204 C-Class came before the W205 C-Class, and the W206 C-Class succeeded it. The fourth-generation
        C-Class was offered in the W205 sedan, S205 estate/station waggon, C205 coupe, A205 cabriolet, and V205
        long-wheelbase sedan body types. The brand-new Modular Rear Architecture (MRA) platform was initially used in
        the W205. The new design uses a lot
        more aluminium throughout the body, making it substantially lighter and reducing weight by 100 kg (220 lb).
        Mercedes-Benz claims that the structure is far more robust than that of other cars in its class.</h3>

    <h3>The Mercedes-AMG C63 S E Performance sedan in 2023 has plenty of power under the hood. It has the highest power
        ever in a C63 sedan, with 670 horsepower and 752 lb-ft of torque. According to AMG, it can accelerate from 0 to
        60 mph in 3.2 seconds and reach 174 mph on the autobahn.</h3>

    <h1>Interior</h1>
    <p>
    <h3>Both styles are available with your choice of interior decorations made of wood or aluminium and come standard
        with leather upholstery. The optional AMG Performance seats, which offer a ventilation feature, have a lot of
        appeal to us. In essence, this is an attractive vehicle, and the inside materials and atmosphere are in line
        with the high asking price. Should you so choose, you can equip the cockpit with additional technologies.</h3>

            (combined fuel consumption, weighted: 6.9 l/100 km; 
            combined CO2 emissions, weighted: 156 g/km; 
            combined electric energy consumption, weighted: 11.7 kWh/100 km) 
            is a real game changer in the 55-year history of AMG.</pre>
