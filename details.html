    <h3>The Ferrari F40 (tipo F120) is a mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive sports car with Pininfarina's style. It was
        created by Nicola Materazzi. The LM and GTE race vehicle variants were produced until 1994 and 1996,
        respectively.
        It was manufactured from 1987 to 1992. It served as the 288 GTO's successor and was the final Ferrari
        vehicle
        that Enzo Ferrari personally approved. The 288 GTO was also engineered by Materazzi and created to
        commemorate
        Ferrari's 40th anniversary. It was Ferrari's fastest, most potent, and most expensive vehicle available for
        purchase at the time.</h3>

    <h3>The French Sport Auto September 1988 cover showed 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.7 seconds and a top speed of 321 km/h
        (199 mph) based on the first independent measurements. In a shootout hosted by Auto, Motor und Sport at Nard
        Ring, the alleged top speed was the next target. Ferrari sent two vehicles, but neither could exceed a high
        speed of 321 km/h (199 mph). The Porsche 959 S and the Ruf CTR both reached top speeds of 342 km/h and 339 km/h,
        respectively (213 mph).</h3>

    <h1>Interior</h1>
    <p>
    <h3>Pininfarina created a whole new body for it, using panels made of Kevlar, carbon fibre, and aluminium for
        strength and lightness, as well as extensive aerodynamic testing. The adoption of windows and a windscreen made
        of polycarbonate plastic significantly reduced weight. While lacking a sound system, door handles, a glove box,
        leather trim, carpets, or door panels, the cars did feature some air conditioning. The first 50 vehicles built
        had wind-down windows, whereas later vehicles had sliding Lexan windows.</h3>
